# rainbows

Javascript demo of a parametric hue function that can map any float to the RGB components of its hue value on a given range.

The hue function can be manipulated in various ways using the UI and sliders:

- Drag the center point to see the rainbow wrap around it

- The top slider rotates the rainbow around the center point

- The bottom slider changes the intensity of hue shift

- Hue shift increases in scale as the center point is dragged right
