# rainbows

Javascript demo of a parametric hue function that can map any float to the RGB components of its hue value as if it were a point on a rainbow spanning a given range. This means the rainbow can be programmed by a rotation, distance between points, x or y value on the canvas, or *any given function*.

Currently, the hue function is manipulated in various ways using the UI and sliders:

- Drag the center point to see the rainbow wrap around it

- The top slider rotates the trajectory of the foreground droplets

- The second top slider changes the scale of droplets

- The bottom slider changes the amount of hue shift on the foreground droplets
